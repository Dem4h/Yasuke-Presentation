This is a presentation I had to make for my english class where I had to make a presentation about a real life charcter or event that inspired a fictional book, story, movie etc. 

I did that more as a "Challenge" rather than to show off in front of my class mate. I know there are some war crimes code I wrote but I did what was the fastest for me at that time. 

I don't think I'll be commiting too much on that project but feel free to give me feedback !

I used : 
- HTML
- Css
 
I'm thinking about using tailwind css on that project
